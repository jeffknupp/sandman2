 [ ~ Dependencies scanned by PyUp.io ~ ]

`sandman2` automagically generates a RESTful API service from your existing database,
without requiring you to write a line of code. Simply point `sandman2` to your
database, add salt for seasoning, and voila!, a fully RESTful API service with
hypermedia support starts running, ready to accept HTTP requests.  

This is a big deal. It means every single database you interact with, from the
SQLite database that houses your web browser's data up to your production
PostgreSQL server can be endowed with a REST API and accessed programmatically,
using any number of HTTP client libraries available in *every* language.
`sandman2` *frees your data*.

**For developers:**

Imagine you're working for AnonymousCorp and need to access
Group Y's data, which is presented to you through some horrible API or GUI.
Wouldn't it be nice if you could just interact with that database through a REST
API?

More than that, imagine if you could interact with the database through a REST
API **and no one had to write any code**. Not you. Not Group Y. No one.
That means no boilerplate ORM code, no database
connection logic. Nothing. `sandman2` can be run as a command-line tool
(`sandman2ctl`) that just takes your database information as parameters and
connects to it, introspects the schema, generates a RESTful API, and starts the server.

## What Happened to Sandman (1)?

[`sandman`](http://www.github.com/jeffknupp/sandman), the precursor to `sandman2`, is no longer being maintained. `sandman` had almost identical
functionality but had an architecture that reflected the capabilities of the underlying ORM, SQLAlchemy. As of the `0.9` release, SQLAlchemy
introduced the `automap` construct. This fundamentally changed the way that `sandman` *could* interact with the underlying database in a
way that greatly simplified things. All that was needed was the actual effort to rewrite `sandman` from scratch...

`sandman2` has since surpassed the functionality of the original `sandman` and the latter should be considered deprecated/obsolete.

## Quickstart

Install `sandman2` using `pip`: `$ pip install sandman2`. This provides the script
`sandman2ctl`, which just takes the database URI string, described [here](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html). For example, to connect to a SQLite database in the same directory you're running the script, you would run:

```bash
$ sandman2ctl sqlite+pysqlite:///database_file_name
$ sandman2ctl sqlite+pysqlite:///examples/blog.sqlite3  # from a source code checkout
```

To connect to a PostgreSQL database, make sure you install a driver like
`psycopg2` using `pip`, then use the following connection string:

```bash
$ sandman2ctl postgresql+psycopg2://scott:tiger@localhost/mydatabase
```

Again, see [the SQLAlchemy documentation](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html)
for a more comprehensive discussion of connection strings.

## Supported Databases

`sandman2` supports all databases that the underlying ORM, SQLAlchemy, supports.
Presently, that includes:

* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* Oracle
* Microsoft SQL Server
* SQLite
* Sybase
* Drizzle
* Firebird

Third-party packages extend support to:

* IBM DB2
* Amazon Redshift
* SQL Anywhere
* MonetDB

## Admin Interface

One of the best things about the original [`sandman`](http://www.github.com/jeffknupp/sandman) was the *Admin Interface*. Not only does `sandman2` include the Admin Interface, but it modernizes it as well. The layout has been greatly improved, especially when dealing with larger numbers of tables. All of the original functionality of the Admin Interface remains unchanged.

Here's a shot of the new look:

## Customizing 

If `sandman2ctl` doesn't give you fine-grained enough control over your REST
endpoints, or you'd like to restrict the set of tables made available via
`sandman2ctl`, you can easily integrate `sandman2` into your application. See
the [documentation](http://sandman2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more info.

## Running `sandman2` under Docker

`sandman2` has an official docker image at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jeffknupp/sandman2/). Simply `docker pull jeffknupp/sandman2` to get the latest version. It supports the most popular database engines, but not all that `sandman2` currently natively supports. If you'd like to see support for your RDBMS, either add a pull request on this repo (if possible) or create a new issue with the details of your database's Python driver.

#### Example

Here's how one would run `sandman2` to connect to a PostgreSQL database running on one's host machine (i.e. not a remote database, which is far simpler) under Docker **(on a Mac, explained below)**:

1. `$ docker pull jeffknupp/sandman2`
2. `$ docker run -d -e DB_TYPE=postgres -e DB_DRIVER=psycopg2 -e USERNAME=jknupp -e DB_HOST=host.docker.internal -e DATABASE=jknupp -e DB_PORT=5432 -p 9000:5000 sandman2`
3. `$ curl localhost:9000/meta` or open a browser to `http://localhost:9000/admin/`

*Note, `DB_HOST=host.docker.internal` is only necessary for databases that reside on the host system (and the value only works on macOS).* To connect to a database on a remote machine, simply replace that value with the machine's IP or hostname.

#### Parameters

Here are the parameters available to specify your connection information and their meaning:

* `$DB_TYPE` - The type of RDBMS to connect to (e.g. `postgres` or `mysql`)
* `$DB_DRIVER` - The name of the Python library to use as a driver (e.g. `psycopg2` or `pymysql`)
* `$USERNAME` - Database username
* `$PASSWORD` - Database password
* `$DB_HOST` - Database IP or hostname
* `$DB_PORT` - Database port
* `$DATABASE` - Name of database to connect to

Pass each value separately to the `docker run` command with `-e <VARIABLE>=<VALUE>`. Not all are required, but which ones are required differs based on your target RDBMS.
